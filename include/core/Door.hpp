// Door -- THE ONE DOOR (s004, REQUIREMENTS §1.1 / §6, RULES "Undo from the
// first write"). Every change Rouster makes to a user's files goes through
// Door::run. Nothing else in the code base renames, unlinks or writes a user
// file, and the selftest's source gate fails if anything does.
//
// The shape (ARCHITECTURE "the plan is data"):
//
//   module -> Plan{ label, actions[], previewed }      (a module never acts)
//   UI shows the plan; the user unchecks what they don't want; previewed=true
//   Door::run(plan):  policy check, every action, BEFORE anything moves
//                     batch line -> for each action:
//                       intent line (fsync) -> the rename -> done / failed line
//   Door::undo():     the last batch, backwards; each item is checked to be
//                     the SAME file (dev + inode) before it is moved back
//
// Two pictures, not an inverse (docs/undo.md): an action records where the
// thing was (from) and where it went (to) plus its identity; undo moves it
// from `to` back to `from`. No per-verb undo code beyond the Trash's info file.
//
// What the door refuses (policy lives HERE, not in modules -- a module bug
// cannot get past it):
//   * a plan that was not previewed;
//   * anything outside home, or home itself;
//   * anything Protected (scan::never_touch(), any fixes/), at any depth;
//   * a path with a symlinked parent (the rename would land somewhere else);
//   * Rouster's own records (the data dir holding the manifest);
//   * Trashing what is already in the Trash; Moving into the Trash;
//   * a Move onto an existing path, or into a missing folder;
//   * crossing filesystems: the rename fails with EXDEV and nothing is copied.
//
// Two verbs CREATE (s007b, retire / restore): Write (a small text file) and
// Clone (git clone). Each builds in a hidden staging name beside the target
// that the door owns, then ONE rename puts it in place -- never half there.
// Their undo is not a rename back (there was nothing before): the created
// thing goes to the Trash, after the same identity check.
//
// MakeDir (s009, Archive) makes one empty folder the same way (staging name,
// one rename). A plan may make a folder and then move into it: the policy
// check reads the plan in order, so a later Move may name a folder an earlier
// MakeDir makes. Its undo sends the folder to the Trash -- only while it is
// still empty (undo runs newest first, so the moves have gone back by then).
//
// One verb MOVES NOTHING (s008, Duplicates): Dedupe shares the blocks of `to`
// with `from` (FIDEDUPERANGE -- the kernel compares the bytes itself, under
// lock, and shares nothing if they differ; a stale hash can't do harm). Both
// paths stay, both contents stay; only free space changes. Its undo puts no
// bytes anywhere: the files are and were identical, so the step is closed
// with nothing to move (re-splitting blocks is not a way back, it's a copy).
//
// Copy (s010, new version / templates) makes a new file `to` from the file
// `from` -- a reflink (FICLONE) where the filesystem shares blocks, else the
// bytes -- into a staging name, then one rename. The source is untouched. Its
// undo is a create's: the copy goes to the Trash.
//
// One verb changes SETTINGS, not files (s012d, profile restore, Q11b):
// Settings loads a dconf dump (`content`) with `dconf load /`. Before it does,
// the door saves `dconf dump /` -- what the settings are now -- and the text
// it is about to load into Rouster's records (settings-<id>.before.ini /
// .load.ini, beside the manifest; r.from / r.src). Its undo resets every key
// the load named that the saved dump didn't have, then loads the saved dump:
// the settings are exactly as before. dconf goes through its own service --
// ~/.config/dconf (never-touch) is never opened. A crash between intent and
// outcome can't be looked at; it counts as done (Undo is safe either way).
//
// Hard-delete does not exist here, and will not (§1.1).
